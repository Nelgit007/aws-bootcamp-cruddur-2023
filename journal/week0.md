**Task 5**
### Installing AWS CLI

I Installed the AWS CLI following the ![AWS CLI Installation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I configured the environmantl variable on the CLI for user Nelson_O using the step outlined ![here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)


set env variables
```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
```


I set gitpod to remember env variables
```sh
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
```


I modified the .gitpod configuration file to include the following task

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT

```
