# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Backend App Containerization


### Step 1


I ran Python using the following commands:


```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Then
```sh
cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
cd ..
```


### Step 2

I ensured the port was open

I proceeded to append the url `/api/activities/home` to the link opened on my browser:

See outcome below;

I then stopped the running application, then unset the Backend and Frontend URL's


### Step 3


I Created a docker file for the backend app @ `backend-flask/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```


### Build Container For Backend Application

From the application dir, I ran the following command to build the container image defined in the docker file above;

```sh
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

RUN, to run the image
```sh
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
```

### Sending Curl to Test Server


I sent the following request to test the server on port 4567

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Here is how my containerized Backend Application looks:

### To Gain Access to the Container


I ran the following commmand:

```sh
docker exec <CONTAINER_ID> -it /bin/bash
```

### Delete Image

I removed built image with: 
```sh
docker image rm backend-flask
```

NB: To forcefully remove image run
```sh
docker image rm backend-flask --force
```


## Containerizing Frontend of Cruddur Application

### Run NPM Install

I had to run NPM Install before building the container since it needs to copy the contents of node_modules

```
cd frontend-react-js
npm i
```

### Create Docker File

I Created a dockerfile for the frontend app @: `frontend-react-js/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Build the Container


RUN
```sh
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
```

### To Run the Container

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
```

## Multiple Containers

To run multiple containers, I created a docker-compose.yaml file

### Creating a docker-compose file

I Created a `docker-compose.yml` at the root of my project.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

I ran the command

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Here is how my catainerized app looks:

## Important Docker CMDs

### Sending Curl to Test Server

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Checking Container Logs

```sh
docker logs CONTAINER_ID -f
docker logs backend-flask -f
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID -f
```

###  Debugging  adjacent containers with other containers

```sh
docker run --rm -it curlimages/curl "-X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\""
```

busybosy is often used for debugging since it install a bunch of thing

```sh
docker run --rm -it busybosy
```

### Gaining Access to a Container

```sh
docker exec CONTAINER_ID -it /bin/bash
```

> You can just right click a container and see logs in VSCode with Docker extension

### Delete an Image

```sh
docker image rm backend-flask --force
```

> docker rmi backend-flask is the legacy syntax, you might see this is old docker tutorials and articles.

> There are some cases where you need to use the --force

### Overriding Ports

```sh
FLASK_ENV=production PORT=8080 docker run -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
```

> Look at Dockerfile to see how ${PORT} is interpolated
